### 1) How do you see the files changed within each commit from git log? <code>git log --stat</code>

### 2) How do you see the contents of what changed within each file from the git log? <code>git log --patch</code>

### 3) What does HEAD refer to in the context of git? (Not to be confused with the "HEAD<<<<" one observes within merge conflict) 
HEAD always points to the most recent commit which is reflected in the working tree.
